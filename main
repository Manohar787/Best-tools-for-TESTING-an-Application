Example code in Selanium Automation Testing in  PYTHON


from selenium import webdriver

# Create an instance of the webdriver
driver = webdriver.Firefox()

# Navigate to the website
driver.get("http://www.example.com")

# Find the search box element and enter a search query
search_box = driver.find_element_by_name("q")
search_box.send_keys("Selenium Testing")
search_box.submit()

# Check if the search results page contains the word "Selenium"
assert "Selenium" in driver.page_source

# Close the browser window
driver.quit()
This test opens a Firefox browser, navigates to the example.com website, enters a search query for "Selenium Testing," and checks if the word "Selenium" appears on the search results page. Finally, the test closes the browser window.
